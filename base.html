    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Sticker Shop is a fundraiser for the Gifted Math Program at the University of Buffalo.
    It was created by Abraham Joseph and Agneya Pooleery (GMP II) and Juwon (GMP I).
    We started off by trying to create a website in which we could sell stickers and launch it on GMP Symposium
